# Junior Data Analyst: Job-Market-Analysis

## A project aimed to analyze the Ukrainian job market for the requirements for Junior Data Analyst position


## Introduction

As a Junior Data Analyst currently looking for a job, the idea was simple: analyze the key skills Ukrainian companies ask for during the hiring process. I tried to find any data before building this project, but the search did not give anything.
That is when I decided to build it. Overall, the structure looks like this


The website that was chosen to scrape the data from is [djinni](https://djinni.co/jobs/), as it is one of the bigger job aggregators out there

## Choosing the website

There are several rather large IT job aggregators in Ukraine. However, my choice fell onto [djinni](https://djinni.co/jobs/), because it seemed to contain the most currently available positions and was easy to scrape.

## Choosing relevant information

Now that we have determined the website, let's explore it a bit to understand which information will be relevant for us to retrieve.
